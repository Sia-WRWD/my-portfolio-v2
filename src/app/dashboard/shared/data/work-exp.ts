            During this time, I continued working with the Angular Framework (which really came in handy

            experience with the .NET framework for backend development. I engaged in diverse projects,

            <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/a-goog-trans" target="_blank">translation library</a>, and topology. Despite being an internship,

        jobDesc: `This was my first internship, and it was eye-opening. I got to see what 
        working in IT is really like, learning about different programming languages, frameworks, 
        and project management. But the best part was getting hands-on with Angular, a JavaScript 
        framework. It helped me understand JavaScript and TypeScript better and made it easier to 
        pick up similar frameworks like React and Vue. Plus, I got to explore things like authentication, 
        database via MySQL, and building APIs via NodeJS. It was a great learning experience!`,
